# Dijkstra UI Challenge

This project recreates a Figma-based UI design using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  
It includes 3 UI states: initial form, filled form, and result display.

## Setup

Just open `index.html` in your browser — no build tools or frameworks required.

## Structure

- `index.html` – Main layout
- `styles.css` – Figma-based styling
- `script.js` – Basic interactivity (optional)
- `assets/illustrations/` – Exported SVGs for each UI state
